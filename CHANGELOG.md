## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-11

Two months of accumulated work released off `v0.6.0`. No breaking API changes — the only
public-surface delta is additive.

### Added

- **`<tosi-scroll-map>`** (`TosiScrollMap` / `tosiScrollMap`) — declarative, waypoint-driven
  scroll controller for a tosijs-ui `<tosi-map>` (Mapbox). `<tosi-waypoint coords="lat,lng,zoom">`
  children become keyframes; latitude, longitude, and zoom interpolate independently as the
  section pins. `easing` attribute (default linear).
- **Cinematic README landing page** rendered by the doc-system — the full narrative authored as
  plain declarative HTML (raw-HTML-in-markdown, hydrated by the IIFE build).
- **Per-component doc pages** (e.g. `<tosi-interpolator>`) from `src/` doc-comment blocks and
  `src/docs/*.md`.

### Changed

- **Build pipeline now uses the `tosijs-ui/site` doc-system** (`bin/site.ts`), replacing the
  legacy standalone build (kept as `build:legacy`). Emits the static doc site to `docs/` plus
  the npm artefacts in `dist/` and `llms.txt`.
- **`tosijs-ui` peer bumped to `^1.6.19`** — picks up fully declarative media scenes, including
  `<tosi-3d>`, so the whole narrative is pure HTML with no JS orchestration.
- README samples render as static code; hero typography and prose column layout polished against
  the doc-system theme.

### Fixed

- Doc-system integration for the README hero engine.
- `tjs-lang` build coupling that broke the IIFE build after the tosijs-ui bump.
- Dropped a dead last-section exit-scroll code path.
